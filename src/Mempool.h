 File Description:

      This file contains the declarations and definition of variables 
      used in the Mempool.c file.

 File Name:

 Version:
 
       1.2

 Abstract:

      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a
      LBeacon is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D
      coordinates and location description of every LBeacon are retrieved
      from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) and
      stored locally during deployment and maintenance times. Once
      initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and location
      description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
      area.
