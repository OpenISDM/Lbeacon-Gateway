  File Description:

     This file, contain the definitions and declarations of constant structure.
     and function used in both Gateway and LBeacon.

  File Name:

     BeDIS.h

  Abstract:

     BeDIS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual descriptions of
     their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon is an inexpensive,
     Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and location description
     of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and
     Information System) and stored locally during deployment and maintenance
     times. Once initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and
     location description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
     area.
