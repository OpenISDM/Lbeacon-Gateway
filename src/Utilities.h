 File Description:

      This is the header file containing the function declarations and
      variables used in the Utilities.c file.

 File Name:

      Utilities.h

 Abstract:

      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon
      is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and
      location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS
      (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally
      during deployment and maintenance times. Once initialized, each LBeacon
      broadcasts its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth
      enabled user devices within its coverage area.
